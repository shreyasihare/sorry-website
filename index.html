  <p class="text">
    Nayan, I am very sorry that I hurt you so much with my words, but I love you very much.
    Sometimes my actions may hurt you, but my heart never means that.
    <br><br>
    I know I said very hurtful and bad things to you yesterday and caused you a lot of pain,
    and I am truly sorry for that — it was never my intention.
    <br><br>
    Please forgive me.
