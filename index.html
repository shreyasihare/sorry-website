    <h1>Hey Nayan 💖</h1>

    <p class="note">
        Nayan, I am very sorry that I hurt you so much with my words, but I love you very much.
        Sometimes my actions may hurt you, but my heart never means that.
        I know I said very hurtful and bad things to you yesterday and caused you a lot of pain,
        and I am truly sorry for that — it was never my intention.
        <br><br>
        Please forgive me. I love you so much, my sweet baby, and I want us to spend our future together.
        Whatever I said in anger was not what I truly meant — in my heart, I only want my future to be with you.
        <br><br>
        This is a small apology from me to you, and if my words have hurt you deeply, I am truly sorry.
        I know you are not in the best emotional state right now, but I promise I will do my best from my side.
        <br><br>
        I love you, baby ❤️❤️❤️
    </p>
